We out here building a tip calculator app. We got the following inputs:

- Bill amount
- Tip amount (preset & custom)
- Number of people

Given these inputs, we need to calculate the total tip and the tip per person and display it to the user.

Don't worry too much about styling at first. Try to nail the interactions and get the HTML right. If you really want to style, focus on basic layout styling first.

There are screenshots in the `design` directory, which also contains a Figma file if you are interested. Additionally, there are a few images in `src/assets/images` that you may wish to use (two icons & a logo).

Have fun!
